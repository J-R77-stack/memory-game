- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
      * Used for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
      * Used to store the code once pushed from Git. 


### What I learned

It was good practice for understanding JavaScript more

### Continued development

Continue to practice JavaScript. This project was not completely finished. I still want to add more game options such as 1-4 players, 4 x 4 grids, numbers and results for players to see.

### Useful resources
